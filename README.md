eventbriteEmbeddedCheckout.html :

Provides an embedded checkout for events hosted on eventbrite.
If the site is hosted on Squarespace, the following element produces a button in the same style as the site theme <a id="myButton" class="list-item-content__button sqs-block-button-element sqs-block-button-element--medium sqs-button-element--primary>
  
For any other host the button element will provide the same functionality and can be customized as desired: <button id="myButton">Register</button>
  
The variable EventId should be set to the Eventbrite EventId for which tickets are to be sold.
